This is about my development at the coding bootcamp I am a part of "Coding Dojo", this displays my personal work around HTML & CSS. Soon I will have work in JavaScript being displayed as well. 
Currently I have been learning about many topics specifically how to learn as a future self sufficient program but here are some topics such as indentation, HTML structure (head & body), CSS Selectors, FLEX, inline vs. block, and divs vs ID# use.
